HomeBridge plugin for SNMP Switch

A thought that I could create snmp base homebridge plugin for my network switch using the PDU plugin from 
https://github.com/invliD/homebridge-digipower-pdu while I have gotten many things to work but I cannot 
decide how to iterate ports that are active/ ports that are not enabled/ ports that are powered / ports 
that power is disabled.

the method invliD used isgreat for iterating thru a number of interfaces works very well.
